# danbooru-tag-website

Very simple and minimalistic webpage that provides a demo for [DeepDanbooru](https://github.com/KichangKim/DeepDanbooru).

First download the precompiled model and place it under the `model` folder.

To run the application, be sure to have Python > 3.8 installed. then create a virtual environment
```sh
$ python3 -m venv .
$ ./bin/activate
$ ./bin/python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

then just run the application with `run.sh` script.
